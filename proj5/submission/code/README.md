# CS180 Proj5: Fun with Stable Diffusion!

## The Code

All the code required to generate the images is located in the `main.ipynb` file.

Note: due to computational limitations, I executed this notebook across both google collab and jupyter notebook locally, so not all the cells on main.ipynb is executed as I ran parts of the code on google collab. However the code in the notebook is consistent with the code that was used. Therefore, I recommend looking at the website results instead of the notebook results!

## How to Run the Code

Open the `main.ipynb` and run all cells
